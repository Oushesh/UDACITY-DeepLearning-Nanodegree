# UDACITY-DeepLearning-Nanodegree
Requirements: Avoid using newer versions of tensoflow like Tensorflow 1.4.1 since some of the functionalities of the code specially for RNN and calling the LSTM memory cell would have to be changed according to the new Tensorflow. 
1)Tensorflow 1.0 or 1.01 used
2) Python 3.5

Another option would be just to write a requirements.txt and do pip install on Linux and that should be fine
